# Development Environment

This page owns the local toolchain requirements. Workflow-specific commands and
checks live in [Task Playbooks](playbooks/README.md).

## Required Tools

| Tool | Used for | Repository expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Git | Branches, worktrees, diffs, and commits | Use an isolated worktree for normal changes. |
| Node.js and npm | TypeScript, web bundles, VitePress, JavaScript checks, and task entry points | CI uses Node.js 24. Run `npm ci` after checkout or lockfile changes. |
| Python 3 | Generators, validators, the check graph, and local ESPHome wrapper | Python must include `venv` support for CI-equivalent dependency isolation. |
| CMake and CTest | Host-side firmware tests in `check:fast` | CMake 3.20 or newer. CI falls back to 3.31.10. |
| C++ compiler | Firmware parser, modal-layout, and saved-config host checks | A C++17 compiler available as `c++`, `g++`, or `clang++`. MSVC alone is not supported by the host checks. |
| Playwright Chromium | Browser-level configurator checks | The npm package is pinned by `package-lock.json`; install its Chromium runtime separately. |
| ESPHome CLI | Local compile, flash, and log workflows | Match `ESPHOME_VERSION` in `.github/esphome.env`; `scripts/local_esphome.py` rejects a different version. |
| Docker | Full firmware matrix, nightly, and release builds | A running Docker daemon able to pull the pinned ESPHome image. |
| GitHub CLI | PR and release-maintainer workflows | Authenticate before using repository release or PR automation. |

## Install Project and Browser Dependencies

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
```

On Linux, use Playwright's dependency installer when the host libraries are not
already available:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Install CMake 3.20 or newer and a C++17 compiler through the host package
manager. The CI fallback version is documented in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
On Windows, run the host check suite in a Linux environment with the documented
GNU or Clang compiler until its CMake and Python test commands support MSVC.
The Visual Studio Developer shell lets CMake find `cl.exe`, but the current
tests pass GNU-style flags and cannot compile with it.
For native Windows Python checks, set `PYTHONUTF8=1` in the shell first so
Python reads repository UTF-8 files independently of the system code page.

For local firmware work, install the ESPHome version named in
`.github/esphome.env` into the active Python environment. Full matrix and
release firmware builds use the matching `ghcr.io/esphome/esphome` Docker image
instead of the host CLI.

## Verify the Environment

```bash
node --version
npm --version
python3 --version
cmake --version
c++ --version
docker info
npx playwright --version
```

Then verify generated output and the broad local check graph:

```bash
python3 scripts/build.py --check
npm run check:fast
```

Browser checks additionally require the installed Chromium runtime. Firmware
compiles require either the pinned host ESPHome CLI for local device work or
Docker for the repository's matrix/release workflow.

## Browser USB Installer

`npm run docs:build` checks the resolved flashing library and builds the installer
into the docs. Run `npm run docs:check-installer` after building to check panel
selection and all three installer entry points in Chromium with mocked Web Serial.
These checks do not flash hardware. The ESP Web Tools dependency overrides in
`package.json` retain the P4 v3.1/v3.2 flash-power fix and compatible Material styles;
retest them when upgrading. Device testing must still cover a production-silicon
P4 and an older supported panel.
